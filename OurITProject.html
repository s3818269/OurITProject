<li><strong><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong><u><strong>Topic</strong></u></strong></li>
<p>We are going to run the app in Vietnam, so I have to learn Vietnamese while going to school. After graduating from school, they join YouTube or Twitch to learn the overall skills of live streaming. Enter the company and enter the IT management department to learn how to manage the server. I also learn how to design apps. Design the app with the skills learned in the company. You have to choose the design, but the design has to keep up with the social trend, so you have to hold a design contest at the university and choose the design of the app. Many customers will use the app, so they will need a lot of administrators. Also, since the app is aimed at the world, it selects a manager who is fluent in Vietnamese and English. When planning the overall future of the app, it includes not only the ideas of the high-end but also the ideas of the young people.
</p>
<li><strong><u><strong>Motivation</strong></u></strong></li>
<p> Ella Zoe Doan, Jun 5, 2020, Number of internet users in Vietnam from 2017 to 2023 Retrieved from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/369732/internet-users-vietnam/#statisticContainer">https://www.statista.com/statistics/369732/internet-users-vietnam/#statisticContainer</a> “In 2018, there were about 54.7 million internet users in Vietnam. By 2023, it was forecasted to be 75.7 million.” Currently, the Internet usage in Vietnam is increasing rapidly. I decided that it would be effective to make this project related to the Internet. And the young people of today's generation are full of individuality and like to express themselves. For example, on Instagram and Facebook, people express their individuality a lot with pictures. Therefore, there will be many people who want to express themselves through Internet broadcasting. So I thought of this project.</p>
<li><strong><u><strong>Landscape</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol><p>Typical apps for live streaming are Twitch and YouTube. The biggest difference between these apps, which have already been successful worldwide, and the apps we want to develop, is that the apps we will create include Vietnamese sentiment and keep up with the young trend. This app is an app in Vietnam. Since Vietnamese people are very united, they will use our app rather than using YouTube or other overseas live streaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u><strong>Detailed Description:</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong><u><strong>Aims</strong></u></strong></li>
<p> (09 10 2020), Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, Retrived from: <a href="http://www.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php/items/14214">http://www.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php/items/14214</a> In 2018, about 20 million tourists came to Vietnam, and in terms of graph, the number of tourists will increase even more. Many people already wonder about Vietnam. So the first and ultimate goal of all the things we can get by creating this app is to let the world know the unique charm that only Vietnamese and Vietnamese have.
The second goal is to improve Vietnam's economy, Phan Anh, April 26 2019, Vnexpress, Vietnam among Youtube’s Top five global market, Retrived from: <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-among-youtube-s-top-five-global-markets-3914469.html">https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-among-youtube-s-top-five-global-markets-3914469.html</a> Based on YouTube usage time, Vietnam ranks among the top five in the world. Already, many Vietnamese enjoy watching the video and are making their own videos. Their talents affect the development of Google headquarters rather than the development of Vietnam's own market.
The third goal is to change society's standards of success. The criteria for success vary from person to person, and generally it is to get a good job. The way to get a good job is to study well. In general, a successful person is not a talented person, but a good student. Each person has his or her own personal talent, even if it's not necessarily studying. People give up their talents and study to reach the standard of success that society has created. Broadcasts show that people who are good at studying become famous rather than those who are talented in certain fields. For example, a good soccer player, a good origami player, a good game player, a good haircutter, a good dresser. Instead of forcing students to study, the goal is to change social trends so that they can find talents they like and do well.
</p>
<li><strong><u><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></u></strong></li>
<p>The Internet usage rate in Vietnam is increasing every year. Also, the younger generation of Vietnam these days prefer to express their individuality, so it is considered very effective to use it when making projects. In Vietnam, there is already a way to broadcast personal broadcasts. For example, people can use YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram to broadcast the Internet in Vietnam. Pan Anh, April 26, 2019, Vietnam was one of the top five global markets for YouTube. Currently, many Vietnamese people useYouTube, but there is no app that has a uniqueVietnamese feel. For example, there is Twitch in theU.S., which takes into account the characteristics of the U.S. itself, followed by AfreecaTV in Korea and DOUYU in China. So I thought about this project because I thought it would be effective to create anInternet broadcasting app that uses the characteristics of Vietnam. 

First, we graduate from IT University and get a job on Twitch or YouTube to learn basic skills about live streaming. After fully learning the skill, set up a company with company employees. Since the design of the app has to keep up with the trend of young people, the university holds a contest to choose the design of the app. 
I will tell you how to run the app. The app is called "Pho," which is famous worldwide and familiar to Vietnamese people.If we are not satisfied with the results of the App Design Competition, design the app directly. Vietnam is a hot country in general, and uses cool skyblue to design the app using the shape of a rice noodle dish. Game broadcasts, talk broadcasts, soccer broadcasts. If you mix them together without dividing them by type, it will be difficult for viewers to find the kind of broadcast they want. Therefore, the types of broadcasting are largely divided into five categories.Communication only, mukbang only, game only,sports only, animation only. The types of this broadcast will be placed on the top of the top to make it easier to see. If the viewer clicks one of the five types, the broadcast will be listed in order of the number of viewers. Everyone can watch the broadcast,but everyone can do it, so we have to control  broadcasts of the intensity. Therefore, managers control the level of each room. If the broadcast is too provocative or too high,it gives a warning or allows the broadcast to end.Also, there is no age limit for watching the show, so when smoking or drinking on the show, only adults can watch the show through adult certification. If too many viewers are gathered in one broadcast, there may be errors in the broadcast. If 1,000 people are gathered for one broadcast, the audience will not be able to enter after 1,000, but they will be able to book the show.  And since there are many customers who use it, we also establish a call center to help them solve their personal problems. When the viewers spon their favorite program, the money is transferred to the company account first. And the broadcaster can receive a fee of 10 percent and an amount excluding tax whenever the broadcaster wants</p>
<li><strong><u><strong>Roles</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ju Jinho will be in charge of web design and web management. The web will be designed to be easy for anyone to use by using pictures or characters.
Nghia will be the Web Developer who is in charge of developing and modifying the source code of our program. He will also configure the streaming function for the project as well as find the errors and handle them. Hao will serve at the Database Administrator position in this project. This position will focus on developing, planning and maintaining the database system. As well as troubleshoot every data issue and take responsibility to ensure integrity and confidentiality of the whole data system. 
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u><strong>Scope and Limits</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our desirable goal are the livestreaming&nbsp;videos reach to full HD resolution. Live chat that streamers can interact to the viewers and connection is stable during the stream. Our website is also expected to have bandwidth for 100,000 viewers access at the same period of time. Due to limited time and resources, we can not achieve the goal that we expected. After next 2 month, we predict that our video quality can only reach 480p at max. Moreover, it is not guaranteed that the connection will not be interrupted during the whole livestream. We still do not create the live chat function. For the bandwidth issues, for now we can only afford for 30,000 to 40,000 people to join the stream.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are countless tools to create a livestream platform like Twitch, NimoTv, NoNo Live. Each tool has a different programming method and different algorithms that are suitable for many types of website. For our project, we decided to use Wowza Streaming Engines tools to build up the livestream app on a web platform. Wowza Streaming Engine is also known as Wowza Media Server prior to version 4. Developed and created by Wowza Media Systems.</p>
<p>Wowza is a unified live media server software. Use the server to stream videos and play back videos, audio on demand via IP network to transmit to computer devices such as PCs, laptops. In addition, the server is developed based on JavaScript programming. This software is asking for licenses, besides that, there will be a 30-day free trial for developers. However, this free trial version can only provide the basic functionality to create a livestream platform. But to be able to develop more deeply and diversified, this application requires developers to purchase for the licenses and get the latest Wowza version. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 is the latest authorized version for developers. In order to run and maintain the website stably, we need hardware devices able to work at the system server. We choose a workstation-oriented computer configuration which has a CPU and VGA that is strong enough to be able to work multi task functions, such as encode videos, and host a server. In order to host a server and record livestream, we use Wowza Streaming Cloud version 1.3.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u><strong>Testing</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two steps to test our project, which are code testing and functionality testing. First of all, our team is using a code checking tool called SONAR, this tool will compare our code with the standard code then check if there are any coding violations. After that, upload all the code through GitHub in order to receive feedback from peers developers in order to optimize the code. Secondly, we test the function of our project by broadcasting a testing livestream and see the outcome. Furthermore, to test if our program can run on different kinds of devices we create the early access version of our project and ask the streamers for testing the new platform. We plan to ask approximately 100 streamers from many regions around the world to test our product and give some feedback to us. In exchange, we will pay a certain amount of money for them. Our expected outcome is the videos have HD quality or higher and connection not being interrupted.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong><u><strong>Risks</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are several risks that our team might encounter during the project. Firstly, our programming, coding skills just reach the amatuer level at the moment. That might lead to some difficulties while we code and f&igrave;nd the bugs, as well as find the solution to debug. One thing that we are concerned about is that all the computer components running in the workstation cannot operate the entire system smoothly because the program requires a more powerful configuration that our computers cannot respond to even though it is running at full capacity and leads to CPU, VGA, RAM throttling. The other risk that may happen is the financial problem. During the project, the price of hardware components that were used to build the workstation can increase, as well as the streamers who we ask to test the products may want more money than we expect. This can make our fund not enough to support our project in the long term.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><u><strong>Group Processes and Communications</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since our world is developing at an extremely fast rate, there are varieties of ways to keep in touch such as Skype, Facebook or my preferred way is face to face. However, due to the on-going situation of the Covid-19 we should limit the original face to face meeting therefore our project team prefers using Microsoft Teams. Since it can sync with Microsoft calendar thus can arrange meetings easily and more precisely.  If there are any problems or questions, all of the team members must communicate via Microsoft Teams and work together on finding the answer.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong><u><strong>Skills and Jobs</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As a project manager, 4 positions that we need to recruit in order to develop this project are Information Architect, Web Developer, User Interface (UI) Designer and Finance Manager. Firstly for the Web Developer position, this job is in charge of coding, designing and layout a website based on the group manager&rsquo;s demand. The web developer is also required to have experience in programming languages such as JavaScript, C++, HTML, database systems. Secondly, the UI Designer is responsible for creating the concept of the user experience, ensuring all interactions are intuitive&nbsp;and easy for customers to use, as well as improve the appearance of the software. In addition, having a skill on various visual design programs and some soft skills such as problem solving skills and teamwork is the must. Thirdly, for the Finance Manager, this job is in charge of planning the budget and providing the financial advice to the team leader. The requirements for this position are negotiation skills, good communication skills, keen eye for detail. Lastly, the Information Architect&rsquo;s missions are to plan and design the information structure for websites and web applications. This job is required to have some experience in web production softwares such as Visio, Dreamweaver, Photoshop.</p>

<p><strong><u><strong>Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>After several weeks working together, I can see that my teammates are wonderful people. About Khai Hao, he is a responsible man that has supported us a lot and always been on time. For Ju Jinho, he has explained his project idea clearly to me so I can understand and work with team. About me, I have tried my best to catch up with the team&rsquo;s progress and be responsible as a member.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>Quach Khai Hao (s3818583)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>One of the three members in the team and especially our team has only been working together for a week due to some human resource problems. Unlike other groups, they have been working together since the very beginning so their collaboration in teamwork will be more effective than our team. However, under these circumstances, I feel that the two members of the group are very active and hard work to be able to coordinate better. About Nghia, he did a great job in the assigned part, besides he always helped me a lot with my part. Next is Jinho, who has teamed with me from assignment 2 and the positive and optimistic of him make me love it. His energy is awesome and he is always motivating for the members to not be discouraged. About myself,  I see a positive effort at work.I am always taking the initiative in appointing everybody in a group and setting out specific times for the whole group to work together. In addition, this team works very professionally because we always have a clear plan, clear path and clear time and schedule before we start working on the project. Guarantee the assignment was submitted on time.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>Ju Jinho (s3807487)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>Vietnam says it is safe from Corona, but Corona is still dangerous. Nevertheless, our team members participated in the meeting well. When I made the team's plan, I made it into a topic that I wanted, but the team members followed my opinion well even though it was a bad one. All of the team members worked hard on the project to carry out the plan rather than trying hard to get a good score on the assignment. Hao is good at collecting information because he knows a lot of information. Nghia knew how to use Git well and cooperated with the new team well</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u><strong>Group Reflection</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong>Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>During the project, I think I have worked harder and better compared to the previous assignment. I have communicated more with other team members and been more responsible to my work progress. One of my problems is that my soft skill is not good. I still have some difficulties in explain my ideas, which is not efficient when working as a team. But from time to time, I believe I will overcome this hurdle. Because of my personality, I am surprised that I am more active and be able to talk more than usual when I work with my team. One thing that I have learned when working with group is that while communicating with team members, I can learn a lot of useful knowledge from them. When discussing, I can see the problems from other aspects, which helps me find better solution.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>Ju Jinho (s3807487)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>When setting a goal for the team's plan, I explained my plan well to the team members. As I embodied the plan, I learned about the world's broadcasting trends and how much Vietnamese people were interested in broadcasting.When I was on the team, I was usually the leader of the team. Instead of listening to others, I persuaded others to make my point. Through this Assignment, I also learned that the best way is to fully consider other people's opinions rather than to listen to others' opinions and put them first.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>Quach Khai Hao (s3818583)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>As stated in the last assignment our group only has two members therefore everything was quite out of control but fortunately we got it together. Luckily, in the last quest, Assignment 3, Nghia was added to our group and our team has more manpower which can make the whole team work easier and more efficiently. The thing that makes me surprised and unexpected is the energy of this group is extremely outstanding. Although the group has only 3 members, a number is not enough to create a group, but the energy they bring is as great as the energy of a group of 4,5 people. Three of us work together, having fun and not feeling any pressure. One thing that I have learnt about grouping is it can be fluctuated and we, our group should have seen that and prepare more wisely.</p>
