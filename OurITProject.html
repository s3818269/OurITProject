</ol>
<p>Hi, I am Nghia, a Vietnamese currently studying at RMIT University Vietnam. My student ID is s3818269 and my email is s3818269@rmit.edu.vn. At present, I have a part time job as an English tutor for some primary and secondary school students. In my free time, I usually read novels, play computer games or watch films. My favorite genre of movies is horror, especially films from Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. I also love dogs, especially pugs. My IT interest came from the movie named Hackers, which I found very amazing and inspiring. Currently I only know a little about MySQL and Python, which I learnt from RMIT.</p>

<li><strong><u><strong>Roles</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Nghia will be the Web Developer who is in charge of developing and modifying the source code of our program. He will also configure the streaming function for the project as well as find the errors and handle them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u><strong>Scope and Limits</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our desirable goal are the livestreaming&nbsp;videos reach to full HD resolution. Live chat that streamers can interact to the viewers and connection is stable during the stream. Our website is also expected to have bandwidth for 100,000 viewers access at the same period of time. Due to limited time and resources, we can not achieve the goal that we expected. After next 2 month, we predict that our video quality can only reach 480p at max. Moreover, it is not guaranteed that the connection will not be interrupted during the whole livestream. We still do not create the live chat function. For the bandwidth issues, for now we can only afford for 30,000 to 40,000 people to join the stream.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are countless tools to create a livestream platform like Twitch, NimoTv, NoNo Live. Each tool has a different programming method and different algorithms that are suitable for many types of website. For our project, we decided to use Wowza Streaming Engines tools to build up the livestream app on a web platform. Wowza Streaming Engine is also known as Wowza Media Server prior to version 4. Developed and created by Wowza Media Systems.</p>
<p>Wowza is a unified live media server software. Use the server to stream videos and play back videos, audio on demand via IP network to transmit to computer devices such as PCs, laptops. In addition, the server is developed based on JavaScript programming. This software is asking for licenses, besides that, there will be a 30-day free trial for developers. However, this free trial version can only provide the basic functionality to create a livestream platform. But to be able to develop more deeply and diversified, this application requires developers to purchase for the licenses and get the latest Wowza version. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 is the latest authorized version for developers. In order to run and maintain the website stably, we need hardware devices able to work at the system server. We choose a workstation-oriented computer configuration which has a CPU and VGA that is strong enough to be able to work multi task functions, such as encode videos, and host a server. In order to host a server and record livestream, we use Wowza Streaming Cloud version 1.3.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u><strong>Testing</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two steps to test our project, which are code testing and functionality testing. First of all, our team is using a code checking tool called SONAR, this tool will compare our code with the standard code then check if there are any coding violations. After that, upload all the code through GitHub in order to receive feedback from peers developers in order to optimize the code. Secondly, we test the function of our project by broadcasting a testing livestream and see the outcome. Furthermore, to test if our program can run on different kinds of devices we create the early access version of our project and ask the streamers for testing the new platform. We plan to ask approximately 100 streamers from many regions around the world to test our product and give some feedback to us. In exchange, we will pay a certain amount of money for them. Our expected outcome is the videos have HD quality or higher and connection not being interrupted.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong><u><strong>Risks</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are several risks that our team might encounter during the project. Firstly, our programming, coding skills just reach the amatuer level at the moment. That might lead to some difficulties while we code and f&igrave;nd the bugs, as well as find the solution to debug. One thing that we are concerned about is that all the computer components running in the workstation cannot operate the entire system smoothly because the program requires a more powerful configuration that our computers cannot respond to even though it is running at full capacity and leads to CPU, VGA, RAM throttling. The other risk that may happen is the financial problem. During the project, the price of hardware components that were used to build the workstation can increase, as well as the streamers who we ask to test the products may want more money than we expect. This can make our fund not enough to support our project in the long term.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><u><strong>Skills and Jobs</strong></u></strong></li>
</ol>

Secondly, the UI Designer is responsible for creating the concept of the user experience, ensuring all interactions are intuitive&nbsp;and easy for customers to use, as well as improve the appearance of the software. In addition, having a skill on various visual design programs and some soft skills such as problem solving skills and teamwork is the must. Thirdly, for the Finance Manager, this job is in charge of planning the budget and providing the financial advice to the team leader. The requirements for this position are negotiation skills, good communication skills, keen eye for detail. Lastly, the Information Architect&rsquo;s missions are to plan and design the information structure for websites and web applications.

<p><strong><u><strong>Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>After several weeks working together, I can see that my teammates are wonderful people. About Khai Hao, he is a responsible man that has supported us a lot and always been on time. For Ju Jinho, he has explained his project idea clearly to me so I can understand and work with team. About me, I have tried my best to catch up with the team&rsquo;s progress and be responsible as a member.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u><strong>Group Reflection</strong></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u><strong>Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269)</strong></u></strong></p>
<p>During the project, I think I have worked harder and better compared to the previous assignment. I have communicated more with other team members and been more responsible to my work progress. One of my problems is that my soft skill is not good. I still have some difficulties in explain my ideas, which is not efficient when working as a team. But from time to time, I believe I will overcome this hurdle. Because of my personality, I am surprised that I am more active and be able to talk more than usual when I work with my team. One thing that I have learned when working with group is that while communicating with team members, I can learn a lot of useful knowledge from them. When discussing, I can see the problems from other aspects, which helps me find better solution.</p>
